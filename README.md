> Black magic on top of MQTT.js

Provides MQTT topic subscription [`EventEmitter`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter)-style (with wildcards!).

Also, `Promise`s.

## Background

> This is my MQTT.js wrapper.  There are many like it, but this one is mine.

[MQTT.js](https://npm.im/mqtt) is an excellent [MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT) client for Node.js & the browser.  It is somewhat of a low-level module, however.

There are two (2) main issues which users of MQTT.js will quickly encounter:

1.  You can't just set a listener function for a subscribed topic; you have to stuff logic into a listener on the `message` event, and figure out what to do with the topic.
2.  Received messages are all `Buffer`s, and when publishing, your message must be a `string`, `Buffer`, or `ArrayBuffer`.
3. (BONUS ISSUE) It doesn't use `Promise`s, which some people prefer over callbacks.

`mqttletoad` solves the *first* problem and the *third* problem.

### Listeners for Specific Topics

When subscribing to an MQTT topic, you can use wildcards (`+` and `#`).  If you do, then you have to *match* an incoming message's topic.  Say we subscribed to:

```
foo/+/baz
```

with a listener function `quux()`.  And an we receive a message with topic:

```
foo/bar/baz
```

How do we know to execute `quux()`?

We need something like a *router* (think [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)) to be able to match the topic to the proper listener.

[EventEmitter2](https://npm.im/eventemitter2) does exactly this by supporting wildcards in event names.  It's flexible, so you *don't* need to use Express-style routes (`foo/:param/baz`), which is what several other libraries tackling the same problem have done.

What's better is that `EventEmitter`s are standardized.  They are easy to consume.  Think [RxJs](https://npm.im/rxjs)'s `Observable.fromEvent()`.  This should help those using a "reactive" programming model.

### Promise Support

[async-mqtt](https://npm.im/async-mqtt) does the same thing.  I wanted it.

### WONTFIX: Message Formats

MQTT makes no prescriptions about what your message looks like.  It's just a [blob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object).  A JavaScript object is neither of these!  If you need to publish an object, call `JSON.stringify` on it first:

```js
const obj = {goin: 'on'};
client.emit('fever/flavor', JSON.stringify(obj));
```

When subscribing, you will *always* receive a `Buffer`.  You'll need to unwrap it yourself:

```js
client.on('a/licky/boom/boom/down', buf => {
  const obj = JSON.stringify(String(buf));
});
``` 

A better idea may be to put some metadata in your topic about the message format, but again, this is up to you:

```js
const formatters = {
  json: val => String(JSON.stringify),
  text: String,
  yaml: parseYaml
};

client.on('radscript/4ever/format/+', (buf, {topic})=> {
  const format = topic.split('/').pop();
  const result = formatters[format](buf);
});
```

## Install

**Node.js v6.5 or greater required**.

```bash
$ npm install mqttletoad
```

## Usage

```js
async function connect() {
  const toad = require('mqttletoad');
  const client = await toad.connect('wxs://test.mosquitto.org')
  // a "real" `MqttClient` event.  these are whitelisted
  client.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.warn('disconnected; reconnecting...');
  })
    .on('winken/+/nod', (buf, packet) => {
      // an MQTT event
      console.log(`topic: "${packet.topic}", message: "${String(buf)}"`);
      }, {qos: 1})
    .on('suback', ({topic}) => {
      // another "real" (non-MQTT) event
      console.log(`subscribed to ${topic}`);
    });
  
  // note this breaks the `EventEmitter#emit` contract.  this might change!
  await client.emit('phi/slamma/jamma', 'go local sports team', {qos: 2});
}
```

## API

Basically it's [async-mqtt](https://npm.im/async-mqtt) except:

- Use `on(topic, [opts], handler)` to subscribe
- Use `removeListener(topic, handler)` to unsubscribe (only if there are no more active listeners on this topic)
- Use `emit(topic, message, [opts])` to publish
- Listen for event `suback` if you want "subscribe" confirmation 
- Listen for event `unsuback` if you want "unsubscribe" confirmation
- Surprises!

## Roadmap

- Use ES modules so it can work in the browser (the whole point of this was to use it in the browser...)
- Not sure if I love `emit()` working like it does
- Probably use [prettier](https://npm.im/prettier)
